### What I learned

Understood working of grid in tailwind css and also the benefit of using it to conditionally render row or columns according to row flow of col flow. Played with grid and flexbox to get the desired output. Good chunk of time spent of learning to implement this and it's feels rewarding learnt few new tricks about using tailwind.
